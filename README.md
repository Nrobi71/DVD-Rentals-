SCENORIO:

A positive trend in sales of Movies-To-Go DVD Rentals has stakeholders pleased. However, they would like to see more growth. The marketing team has developed a loyalty program for customers to acquire rewards via a point system. The point rewards through a loyalty program will convince current customers to rent again and maintain relevance with both existing and future clientele. This will build the most revenue by utilizing a much cheaper marketing strategy. To kick off this promotion, we will reward our top ten renters each with 10,000 points multiplied by the number of their total rentals. The points earned can be used towards multiple free rentals. The customers will receive a confirmation of their rewarded points by email.


REQUIREMENTS:

A.   Summarize one real-world business report that can be created from the attached Data Sets and Associated Dictionaries. 

1.  Describe the data used for the report.

2.  Identify two or more specific tables from the given dataset that will provide the data necessary for the detailed and the summary sections of the report.

3.  Identify the specific fields that will be included in the detailed and the summary sections of the report. 

4.  Identify one field in the detailed section that will require a custom transformation and explain why it should be transformed. For example, you might translate a field with a value of ‘N’ to ‘No’ and ‘Y’ to ‘Yes’.

5.  Explain the different business uses of the detailed and the summary sections of the report.

6.  Explain how frequently your report should be refreshed to remain relevant to stakeholders.
